# uci-node-ldap
A search tool based on [ldapjs](https://github.com/mcavage/node-ldapjs) which adds UCI's LDAP base and allows non-credentialed search to the extent allowable by OIT.
It is very simple so far and has very little concept of searches, but it is a minor step to make ldap more accessible to those who just need to search quickly for basic information like campus_id, name, email, phone number, etc. only things which one can already get from [the directory](http://directory.uci.edu/).

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save git@github.oit.uci.edu:education/node-ldap.git
```


## Usage
It only has two functions presently, `searchBy` which takes a raw filter, and `searchByNetID` with takes a UCINetID.


```js
var Ldap = require('uci-node-ldap');

uciNodeLdap.searchByNetID('rhett', function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  
  console.log(data);
});

uciNodeLdap.searchBy('(&(cn=Rhett *)(uid=rhett))', function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  
  console.log(data);
});
```

## License
Still working on this. This code is owned by UCI and I guess the greater UC, but I am unsure of which license to use exactly. Please use and modify freely, but don't claim ownership.
This is subject to, and will, change without notice.

By all means, if you know LDAP better than me (which is just about everyone), jump right in with a fork and a pull request\!
